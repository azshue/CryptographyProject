# CryptographyProject
here's the source code of my cryptography project
   
2 parts:
1. DES Avalanche Effect
  DES.c: a simple DES encryption algorithm, with several additional functions related to file operation
  plot.py: make the graphic analysis result of avalanche effect
 
  
2. password evaluation
  evaluation.c: give you a reasonable evaluation to the password you input, details are in the code
  graph.c: plot the result of the evaluation, the result is represented in a spider graph and two normal distribution graphs.  
  
additional files:   
   some *.txt files are provided, that's the key and plaintext you need to run the program, of courese you can modify them.   
   dict.txt needed in password evaluation
   data.txt and random.txt needed to plot the normal distribution
